Chat app create using neon database and node.js

For this pryect, i used npm, express, morgan and socket.io
I have a login page where yo have tu put the user "admin" or "usuario1" to enter (in the future, i will check with the database if the user is in it)
Then you click on one of the users in the left side and all the chat will load

For running the app you have to put in the terminal the command : npm run devStart
